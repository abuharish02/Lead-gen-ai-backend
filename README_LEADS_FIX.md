# 🚀 Leads Page Fix Guide

## ❌ Current Error: 405 Method Not Allowed

The error shows that the server is running but the leads endpoint is not working properly.

## ✅ What We Fixed

1. **Route Ordering Issue**: Fixed the FastAPI route conflict in `leads.py`
2. **API Consolidation**: Moved all lead API calls to `api.js` (removed redundant `leadService.js`)
3. **Router Registration**: Ensured leads router is properly included in `main.py`

## 🚀 How to Fix the Error

### **Simple Solution: Restart the Backend Server**

The routes are correctly configured, but the server needs to be restarted to pick up the changes.

```bash
# 1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# 2. Start it again:
cd backend
python run.py
```

### **Alternative: Use the Test Script**

```bash
cd backend
python test_leads.py
```

## 🔍 Verify the Fix

1. **Restart the backend server** using `python run.py`
2. **Wait for the server to start** - you should see:
   ```
   INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
   INFO: Application startup complete.
   ```
3. **Test the leads endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/leads
   ```
4. **Refresh your frontend** - the leads page should now work!

## 📋 Route Configuration

The routes are correctly ordered in `backend/app/api/leads.py`:

1. `@router.get("/")` - Get all leads
2. `@router.get("/search/")` - Search leads  
3. `@router.get("/{lead_id}")` - Get specific lead details

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you still get 405 errors:
1. **Ensure the server is restarted** after making route changes
2. **Check the server logs** for any import errors
3. **Verify the leads router is imported** in `main.py`

### If you get connection refused:
1. **Start the backend server** with `python run.py`
2. **Keep the server running** - don't close the terminal window

## 🎯 Expected Result

After restarting the server, you should see:
- ✅ Backend running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- ✅ Leads page loads without 405 errors
- ✅ API calls to `/api/v1/leads` work properly
- ✅ Search and filtering functionality works

## 📞 Need Help?

The leads page should work perfectly once you restart the backend server! 🎉

**Key Point**: The routes are correctly configured - you just need to restart the server to pick up the changes.
